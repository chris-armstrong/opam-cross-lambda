Using ocaml, find instances of `%{variable_name:package_name}%` in a given string. You can use the Re library to help. There may be multiple instances

## CodeCompanion (Anthropic)

### Reasoning

Let me implement a function to find instances of `%{variable_name:package_name}%` in a string using OCaml and the Re library.

The pattern we're looking for matches:
- Starting with `%{`
- Followed by a variable name (alphanumeric and underscores)
- Then a colon `:`
- Then a package name (alphanumeric, underscores, dots)
- Ending with `}%`

Let's code this:

```ocaml
(* Find instances of %{variable_name:package_name}% in a string *)
open Re

let find_patterns str =
  (* Create a regex pattern for %{variable_name:package_name}% *)
  let pattern = Re.compile (Re.seq [
    Re.str "%{";
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'])); (* variable_name *)
    Re.char ':';
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'; Re.char '.'])); (* package_name *)
    Re.str "}%"
  ]) in
  
  (* Find all matches in the input string *)
  let matches = Re.all pattern str in
  
  (* Extract variable_name and package_name from each match *)
  List.map (fun match_result ->
    let groups = Re.Group.all match_result in
    let variable_name = groups.(1) in
    let package_name = groups.(2) in
    (variable_name, package_name)
  ) matches
```

Actually, the function above returns the captured groups (variable_name, package_name). If we want to return the full matched pattern as well, we can modify it:

```ocaml
(* Find instances of %{variable_name:package_name}% in a string *)
open Re

let find_patterns str =
  (* Create a regex pattern for %{variable_name:package_name}% *)
  let pattern = Re.compile (Re.seq [
    Re.str "%{";
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'])); (* variable_name *)
    Re.char ':';
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'; Re.char '.'])); (* package_name *)
    Re.str "}%"
  ]) in
  
  (* Find all matches in the input string *)
  let matches = Re.all pattern str in
  
  (* Extract full match, variable_name and package_name from each match *)
  List.map (fun match_result ->
    let groups = Re.Group.all match_result in
    let full_match = groups.(0) in
    let variable_name = groups.(1) in
    let package_name = groups.(2) in
    (full_match, variable_name, package_name)
  ) matches
```

Let's test this with an example to make sure it works. Actually, let's provide a complete module with a simple test case:

```ocaml
open Re

(* Find instances of %{variable_name:package_name}% in a string *)
let find_patterns str =
  (* Create a regex pattern for %{variable_name:package_name}% *)
  let pattern = Re.compile (Re.seq [
    Re.str "%{";
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'])); (* variable_name *)
    Re.char ':';
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'; Re.char '.'])); (* package_name *)
    Re.str "}%"
  ]) in
  
  (* Find all matches in the input string *)
  let matches = Re.all pattern str in
  
  (* Extract full match, variable_name and package_name from each match *)
  List.map (fun match_result ->
    let groups = Re.Group.all match_result in
    let full_match = groups.(0) in
    let variable_name = groups.(1) in
    let package_name = groups.(2) in
    (full_match, variable_name, package_name)
  ) matches

(* Test with an example *)
let () =
  let test_str = "Hello %{user:system.user}%, welcome to %{app:my.app}%!" in
  let results = find_patterns test_str in
  List.iter (fun (full, var, pkg) ->
    Printf.printf "Found: %s\n  Variable: %s\n  Package: %s\n\n" full var pkg
  ) results
```

This is a solid implementation that:
1. Defines a pattern for `%{variable_name:package_name}%`
2. Finds all occurrences in the input string
3. For each match, extracts:
   - The full match
   - The variable name
   - The package name
4. Returns a list of tuples, each containing these three items

For a cleaner interface, I'll remove the test code from the final answer and just provide the `find_patterns` function:

### Response

Here's a solution using OCaml and the Re library to find all instances of `%{variable_name:package_name}%` in a string:

```ocaml
open Re

let find_patterns str =
  (* Create a regex pattern for %{variable_name:package_name}% *)
  let pattern = Re.compile (Re.seq [
    Re.str "%{";
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'])); (* variable_name *)
    Re.char ':';
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'; Re.char '.'])); (* package_name *)
    Re.str "}%"
  ]) in
  
  (* Find all matches in the input string *)
  let matches = Re.all pattern str in
  
  (* Extract full match, variable_name and package_name from each match *)
  List.map (fun match_result ->
    let groups = Re.Group.all match_result in
    let full_match = groups.(0) in
    let variable_name = groups.(1) in
    let package_name = groups.(2) in
    (full_match, variable_name, package_name)
  ) matches

(* Example usage:
   let test_str = "Hello %{user:system.user}%, welcome to %{app:my.app}%!"
   let results = find_patterns test_str
*)
```

This function returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains (full_match, variable_name, package_name) for each pattern found in the string.

Need help with handling special characters in the variable or package names?

## Me
I want to extend the solution so that as well as finding it, it calls a callback with the variable name and package name and takes a tuple to map them within the original string



## CodeCompanion (Anthropic)

### Reasoning

I'll need to extend the solution to:

1. Find all instances of `%{variable_name:package_name}%` in a string
2. Call a callback function with the variable name and package name for each instance
3. Replace each instance with whatever the callback returns
4. Return the transformed string

Here's how I would approach this:

```ocaml
open Re

let replace_patterns str callback =
  (* Create a regex pattern for %{variable_name:package_name}% *)
  let pattern = Re.compile (Re.seq [
    Re.str "%{";
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'])); (* variable_name *)
    Re.char ':';
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'; Re.char '.'])); (* package_name *)
    Re.str "}%"
  ]) in
  
  (* Replace each match with the result of the callback *)
  Re.replace_fun pattern (fun match_result ->
    let groups = Re.Group.all match_result in
    let variable_name = groups.(1) in
    let package_name = groups.(2) in
    (* Call the callback with variable_name and package_name *)
    callback (variable_name, package_name)
  ) str
```

This function takes two arguments:
1. `str`: The input string where we need to find and replace patterns
2. `callback`: A function that takes a tuple of (variable_name, package_name) and returns a string to replace the pattern

The function uses `Re.replace_fun` to replace each match with the result of the callback function. The callback is given the variable name and package name as a tuple.

Let me check if there are any potential issues with this approach:

- The regex pattern should correctly identify variable names and package names based on the specified format.
- We're using `Re.Group.all` to extract the captured groups, which should work as expected.
- The callback function is called with a tuple (variable_name, package_name) as requested.

This solution should meet the requirements. Let me add an example to demonstrate usage:

```ocaml
(* Example usage *)
let test_str = "Hello %{user:system.user}%, welcome to %{app:my.app}%!"

let result = replace_patterns test_str (fun (var_name, pkg_name) ->
  Printf.sprintf "[$%s from %s]" var_name pkg_name
)

(* This would transform test_str into:
   "Hello [$user from system.user], welcome to [$app from my.app]!" *)
```

In this example, the callback function formats each variable reference in a custom way. But the callback could do anything, including looking up values in a map, performing transformations, etc.

I think this solution is ready, but let me just make sure the pattern would handle all valid variable and package names. The current regex allows alphanumeric characters and underscores for variable names, and alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dots for package names. If there are other characters that should be allowed, the regex would need to be adjusted.

### Response

Here's an extended solution that finds patterns, calls a callback with the variable and package names, and replaces them in the original string:

```ocaml
open Re

let replace_patterns str callback =
  (* Create a regex pattern for %{variable_name:package_name}% *)
  let pattern = Re.compile (Re.seq [
    Re.str "%{";
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'])); (* variable_name *)
    Re.char ':';
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'; Re.char '.'; Re.char '-'])); (* package_name *)
    Re.str "}%"
  ]) in
  
  (* Replace each match with the result of the callback *)
  Re.replace_fun pattern (fun match_result ->
    let groups = Re.Group.all match_result in
    let variable_name = groups.(1) in
    let package_name = groups.(2) in
    (* Call the callback with variable_name and package_name *)
    callback (variable_name, package_name)
  ) str

(* Example usage *)
let example () =
  let test_str = "Hello %{user:system.user}%, welcome to %{app:my.app}%!" in
  
  (* A simple mapping function *)
  let mapping (var_name, pkg_name) =
    match (var_name, pkg_name) with
    | ("user", _) -> "John"
    | ("app", _) -> "Awesome App"
    | _ -> sprintf "[Unknown: %s from %s]" var_name pkg_name
  in
  
  let result = replace_patterns test_str mapping in
  Printf.printf "Original: %s\nTransformed: %s\n" test_str result;
  
  (* You could also use it with more complex lookups *)
  let value_map = [
    ("user", "system.user", "Alice");
    ("app", "my.app", "Cool Application");
  ] in
  
  let lookup_mapping (var_name, pkg_name) =
    try
      List.find (fun (v, p, _) -> v = var_name && p = pkg_name) value_map
      |> fun (_, _, value) -> value
    with Not_found -> 
      sprintf "[Not found: %s from %s]" var_name pkg_name
  in
  
  let result2 = replace_patterns test_str lookup_mapping in
  Printf.printf "Mapping result: %s\n" result2
```

This solution:

1. Defines a `replace_patterns` function that takes a string and a callback
2. The callback receives a tuple `(variable_name, package_name)` for each pattern found
3. The callback should return a string that will replace the pattern in the original string
4. The function returns the transformed string with all replacements

I provided two example usage scenarios:
- A simple direct mapping function that returns different values based on variable names
- A more complex lookup that uses a list of tuples to find the right replacement value

The pattern now supports alphanumeric characters, underscores, dots, and hyphens in package names. You can adjust the regex pattern further if needed for your specific use case.

## Me


The callback should return a tuple to be mapped back to the variable interpolation form 

## CodeCompanion (Anthropic)

### Reasoning

I see the misunderstanding. The callback should return a tuple that will be used to reconstruct the variable interpolation form, not the direct replacement value. Let me correct this.

The callback will receive `(variable_name, package_name)` and should return a new tuple like `(new_variable_name, new_package_name)` which will be used to construct a string in the format `%{new_variable_name:new_package_name}%`.

Here's the updated solution:

### Response

I understand now. You want the callback to return a new tuple with potentially modified variable and package names, and then have those mapped back to the `%{variable_name:package_name}%` format. Here's the updated solution:

```ocaml
open Re

let replace_patterns str callback =
  (* Create a regex pattern for %{variable_name:package_name}% *)
  let pattern = Re.compile (Re.seq [
    Re.str "%{";
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'])); (* variable_name *)
    Re.char ':';
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'; Re.char '.'; Re.char '-'])); (* package_name *)
    Re.str "}%"
  ]) in
  
  (* Replace each match with a new interpolation form based on callback result *)
  Re.replace_fun pattern (fun match_result ->
    let groups = Re.Group.all match_result in
    let variable_name = groups.(1) in
    let package_name = groups.(2) in
    
    (* Call the callback to get the new variable_name and package_name *)
    let (new_var_name, new_pkg_name) = callback (variable_name, package_name) in
    
    (* Return the new interpolation format *)
    Printf.sprintf "%%{%s:%s}%%" new_var_name new_pkg_name
  ) str

(* Example usage *)
let example () =
  let test_str = "Hello %{user:system.user}%, welcome to %{app:my.app}%!" in
  
  (* Mapping function that returns new (variable_name, package_name) tuples *)
  let mapping (var_name, pkg_name) =
    match (var_name, pkg_name) with
    | ("user", "system.user") -> ("current_user", "auth.user")
    | ("app", "my.app") -> ("application", "core.app")
    | _ -> (var_name, pkg_name)  (* Keep unchanged if no mapping exists *)
  in
  
  let result = replace_patterns test_str mapping in
  Printf.printf "Original: %s\nTransformed: %s\n" test_str result;
  
  (* More complex example with a lookup table *)
  let remap_table = [
    ("user", "system.user", "admin", "admin.user");
    ("app", "my.app", "product", "company.product");
  ] in
  
  let lookup_mapping (var_name, pkg_name) =
    try
      List.find (fun (v, p, _, _) -> v = var_name && p = pkg_name) remap_table
      |> fun (_, _, new_var, new_pkg) -> (new_var, new_pkg)
    with Not_found -> 
      (var_name, pkg_name)  (* Keep unchanged if no mapping exists *)
  in
  
  let result2 = replace_patterns test_str lookup_mapping in
  Printf.printf "Mapping result: %s\n" result2
```

In this updated solution:

1. The `replace_patterns` function takes a string and a callback function
2. The callback receives a tuple `(variable_name, package_name)` and must return a new tuple `(new_variable_name, new_package_name)`
3. The function uses the returned tuple to construct a new interpolation pattern in the same format: `%{new_variable_name:new_package_name}%`
4. The original string is transformed by replacing each pattern with its new version

I've provided two examples:
1. A simple direct mapping function that transforms specific variable/package combinations
2. A more complex lookup using a table of transformation rules

This approach allows you to modify both the variable names and package names while preserving the interpolation format.

## Me

The only problem with this solution is Re does not have a `replace_fun` function. 

## CodeCompanion (Anthropic)

### Reasoning

You're absolutely right - I apologize for the confusion. The `Re` library in OCaml doesn't have a `replace_fun` function directly. Instead, I should use the appropriate functions from the `Re` library to handle the replacements.

Let me correct this solution. In the `Re` library, we typically use:

1. `Re.all` or `Re.all_gen` to find all matches
2. `Re.Group.all` to extract capturing groups from a match
3. `Re.replace_string` or `Re.substitute` for replacements

For a custom replacement function, I would use `Re.replace` which takes a transformation function. Let me rewrite the solution correctly:

### Response

You're right, and I apologize for the error. Let me correct the solution using the proper functions from the Re library:

```ocaml
open Re

let replace_patterns str callback =
  (* Create a regex pattern for %{variable_name:package_name}% *)
  let pattern = Re.compile (Re.seq [
    Re.str "%{";
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'])); (* variable_name *)
    Re.char ':';
    Re.group (Re.rep1 (Re.alt [Re.alnum; Re.char '_'; Re.char '.'; Re.char '-'])); (* package_name *)
    Re.str "}%"
  ]) in
  
  (* Use Re.replace for substitution with a custom function *)
  Re.replace pattern ~f:(fun match_result ->
    let groups = Re.Group.all match_result in
    let variable_name = groups.(1) in
    let package_name = groups.(2) in
    
    (* Call the callback to get the new variable_name and package_name *)
    let (new_var_name, new_pkg_name) = callback (variable_name, package_name) in
    
    (* Return the new interpolation format *)
    Printf.sprintf "%%{%s:%s}%%" new_var_name new_pkg_name
  ) str

(* Example usage *)
let example () =
  let test_str = "Hello %{user:system.user}%, welcome to %{app:my.app}%!" in
  
  (* Mapping function that returns new (variable_name, package_name) tuples *)
  let mapping (var_name, pkg_name) =
    match (var_name, pkg_name) with
    | ("user", "system.user") -> ("current_user", "auth.user")
    | ("app", "my.app") -> ("application", "core.app")
    | _ -> (var_name, pkg_name)  (* Keep unchanged if no mapping exists *)
  in
  
  let result = replace_patterns test_str mapping in
  Printf.printf "Original: %s\nTransformed: %s\n" test_str result;
  
  (* More complex example with a lookup table *)
  let remap_table = [
    ("user", "system.user", "admin", "admin.user");
    ("app", "my.app", "product", "company.product");
  ] in
  
  let lookup_mapping (var_name, pkg_name) =
    try
      List.find (fun (v, p, _, _) -> v = var_name && p = pkg_name) remap_table
      |> fun (_, _, new_var, new_pkg) -> (new_var, new_pkg)
    with Not_found -> 
      (var_name, pkg_name)  (* Keep unchanged if no mapping exists *)
  in
  
  let result2 = replace_patterns test_str lookup_mapping in
  Printf.printf "Mapping result: %s\n" result2
```

This corrected version uses the `Re.replace` function with a custom transformation function passed via the `~f` named parameter, which is the proper way to do replacements with custom logic in the Re library.
